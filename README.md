# Snowball Traders

Very simple mod for VintageStory. It removes the temperature requirement for Traders to spawn, allowing them to spawn near the poles and on snowball earths.

Probably won't break any time soon. Probably won't need updating any time soon. But do feel free to submit an issue or a pull request if you have something that could be improved.
